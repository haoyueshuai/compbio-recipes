This page is meant to help new members learning to use github, contributing to the wiki and finding their "orientation guide". A formal list of lab members can be found on [the CSG homepage](http://statgen.us/).
Please slack a paragraph about yourself and optionally your favorite profile photo to Gao Wang if you would like to create [a profile page like this](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD) to link from that list.
You can also send a link to your profile on a professional service (eg, Google Scholar, linkedIn, github, ORCID, ResearchGate, ...) as an alternative.
